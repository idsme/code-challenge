# Code Challenge

This repository contains 3 challenges of which we would like you to solve two. **You may choose** between skipping either challenge-2 or challenge-3. See this as an opportunity to show us your way of working, with the same quality as you would deliver on the job.

## How to send us your solution

Please donâ€™t make solutions to the code challenge publicly available online.

We would prefer to receive a link to a private repository.

## Typescript

The first challenge is a plain typescript challenge. For the second challenge you can either choose challenge-2 or challenge-3.  
Based on profile we may specifically ask you e.g. to do the Angular challenge.

`challenge-1` and `challenge-2` you can run like: `npm run challenge-1`, `npm run challenge-2`

## Angular (Challenge-3)

The third challenge involves developing a small user story in Angular+. 

The assignment is to create an interface where you can search by flightNumber through gate changes. A gate change is when a flight is directed to a different gate than originally planned. The gate changes, arrival and departure times can change at any time, so API requests should not be cached.  

### Getting started
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Start dev server (http://localhost:4200)
```
npm start
```

You can find the API documentation for this challenge in the `swagger.json` in this repository.
The API can be started with the command `npm run start:api`.  
It will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.  


A brief overview of the endpoints that are available:

-   `/arrivals`
-   `/departures`
-   `/gate-changes`
-   `/gate-changes/:search`

Acceptance criteria for the user story:

Scenario: Searching for gate changes
Given I am on the Code Challenge page  
When I start typing in the input field  
And I have type more than 1 character  
Then a list of maximum 5 gate changes should be shown  


Scenario: Showing arrival / destination for gate changes  
Given I am on the Code Challenge page  
When I start typing in the input field  
And I have type more than 1 character  
Then a list of gate changes should be shown  
And every gate change should include the destination / origin of the flight  


Scenario: Sorting the gate changes  
Given I am on the Code Challenge page  
When I start typing in the input field  
And I have type more than 1 character  
Then a list of gate changes should be shown  
And the list should be sorted based on arrival / departure time of the flight  


Scenario: Clearing gate changes  
Given I am on the Code Challenge page  
When I clear the input field  
Then no gate changes should be shown


Scenario: Hovering effect on gate changes list items  
Given I am on the Code Challenge page, and have a list of gate changes.  
When I hover uneven times (1st time, 3rd time etc...) on a gate change item  
Then the background should have a yellow color  
When I hover even times (2nd time, 4th time etc...) on the same item  
Then the background should have a red color
